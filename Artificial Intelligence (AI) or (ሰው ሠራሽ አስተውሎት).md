## What is AI?

- **Artificial intelligence** is the simulation of **human intelligence** processes by machines, especially computer systems. Examples of AI applications include [expert systems](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/definition/expert-system), natural language processing ([NLP](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/definition/natural-language-processing-NLP)), [speech recognition](https://www.techtarget.com/searchcustomerexperience/definition/speech-recognition) and [machine vision](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/definition/machine-vision-computer-vision).

- AI requires specialized **hardware** and **software** for writing and training machine learning algorithms. No single programming language is used exclusively in AI, but **Python, R, Java, C++ and Julia** are all popular languages among **AI developers**.

## Narrow AI(Weak AI).

- This form of AI refers to models trained to perform **specific tasks**. Narrow AI operates within the context of the tasks it is programmed to perform, without the ability to generalize broadly or learn beyond its initial programming. Examples of narrow AI include virtual assistants, such as Apple Siri and Amazon Alexa, and [recommendation engines](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/recommendation-engine), such as those found on streaming platforms like Spotify and Netflix.
- ያለ ሰው ትዛዝ ምንም ማረግ አይችልም፣ ያለ ሰው መስራት አይችልም።

## General AI(Strong AI).

- This type of AI, which does not currently exist, is more often referred to as artificial general intelligence ([AGI](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/definition/artificial-general-intelligence-AGI)). If created, AGI would be capable of performing any intellectual task that a human being can. To do so, AGI would need the ability to apply reasoning across a wide range of domains to understand complex problems it was not specifically programmed to solve. This, in turn, would require something known in AI as [fuzzy logic](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/definition/fuzzy-logic): an approach that allows for gray areas and gradations of uncertainty, rather than binary, black-and-white outcomes.
- እንደ ሰው በራሱ መስራት ይችላል፣ ይለ ሰው መስራት ይችላሉ።
